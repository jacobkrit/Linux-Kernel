For this tutorial we need an additional software in order to function relative to the LAN connection which does not need additional drivers.\n",

    "# Step 2: USB Status\n",
    "\n",
    "When you connect the cables, It’s time to check the connection status. By opening and Terminal and executing the command ```lsusb``` you should see the name with an output with a similar format, which contains the Name, and basic information of the Keithley Source Measure Unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "![USB-2](images/USB-2.jpg \"USB-2\")\n",

    "For the instrument to communicate with the Computer, we must use a driver, which requires to be able to read a resource string in the following format to receive and send data from the Ubuntu to the Keithley Source Measure Unit: ```USB0::0x05e6::0x2461::[serial number]::INSTR```.\n",
    "Where: \n",
    "- 0x05e6: The Keithley vendorID \n",
    "- 0x2461: The instrument model number \n",
    "- [serial-number]: The serial number of the instrument\n",
    "- INSTR: Use the USB TMC protocol\n",

    "As presented in the above image by executing the command ```lsusb -v```.\n",

    "# Step 3: Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually in Ubuntu in order for the driver to see, read, and write on the device, we need to give the Keithley Source Measure Unit permission from the root. \n",
    "\n",
    "![USB-4](images/USB-4.jpg \"USB-4\")\n",
    "\n",
    "By going to the directory ```/dev/bus/usb``` and by selecting the BUS number, which in our case is ```002``` we see the connected devices on this BUS. By executing the command ```ls -al``` we see the permissions that each connected device on this BUS has. \n",
    "\n",
    "![USB-5](images/USB-5.jpg \"USB-5\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to change these permissions and give full access to the Keithley Source Measure Unit. By going to the directory   ```/etc/udev/rules.d ``` we may write a new rule. By executing the command ```sudo vim 99-param.rules``` we create a new file in which we write the following rule: ```SUBSYSTEM==“usb”, ATTRS{idVendor}==“05e6”, ATTRS{idProduct}==“2461”, GROUP=“root”, MODE=“777”``` and the System Reboot.\n",

    "From the Rohde&Scharz Company download the R&S VISA for Ubuntu driver: https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/driver-pages/remote-control/3-visa-and-tools_231388.html\n",
    "Execute the ```.deb``` program.\n",

    "\n",
    "Open the RsVisa Configure application from the Application Finder of Ubuntu and press the plus icon.\n",
    "In the VISA Resource String manually insert the string  ```USB0::0x05e6::0x2461::::INSTR``` and press the search icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "![USB-8](images/USB-8.jpg \"USB-8\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a pop-up window will appear with the same string you inserted, in case it doesn’t appear click the refresh icon at the bottom-left corner of the window. Press the string and then select and OK.\n",

    "Following the guidelines from the Install NI Driver Software on Linux: https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/documentation/supplemental/18/downloading-and-installing-ni-driver-software-on-linux-desktop.html execute the following commands:\n",

    "After the installation, by executing the command ```visaconf``` or ```NIvisaic``` the NI visa window opens and we should see the USB-connected device ```USB0::0x05e6::0x2461::::INSTR```. You may send queries towards the device.  \n",

    "# Step 5 (A): Communicate with the instrument (Python)\n",

    "NI-VISA is one way to communicate with the device. Nevertheless, we may communicate with the device by using Python, and **WITHOUT using NI-VSA**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially install python and pip with the following command ```sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-pip python3-setuptools``` \n",
    "Then install the VISA packages in python: ```pip3 install pyvisa``` and ```pip3 install pyvisa-py```\n",
